                <h2>Moving out</h2>
                <p>I moved out of my parents home shortly after I graduated. I went to live with my grandparents in Arkansas. It was a very rural place that was very quiet and nice. </p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>
                    I moved to arkansas to attend a nearby college called Henderson State University.
                    I had gotten everything set up and I finally got to the school for registration when I had a feeling. 
                    I knew this wasnt for me. I told my dad and he asked if I was sure, and I said yes, then we left.
                    I knew that type of teaching wasnt effective for me, and I knew I needed somewhere a little more technologically advanced to learn.

                <h2>Going Home</h2>
                <p>
                    After a few months of living in Arkansas I moved back home. I had no idea what to do with my life at that point. 
                    When my brother told me that his job had an opening I sent my very small resume that day.
                    I also bought my first car with the money I earned from that job!
                    Its been a work in progress, but its a very fun hobby and when its working right its so fun!

                <h2>Jobs</h2>
                <p>
                    I got hired at a temp agency called Randstad, it was my first job. 
                    I worked at a couple of warehouses with my brother but we never got hired on by any of them.
                    My brother eventually moved on and found a different job, and I was about to do the same.
                    I decided to try out one more warehouse though.
                    I started at Reaction Auto Parts around the start of February 2019, and it was great!
                    it was a small startup where I got to start fresh and get a good work ethic.
                    I still enjoy it a lot, but I know that I cant do physical labor my whole life.
                    I have always wanted to work with computers and electronics, and I know that will never happen there, so I had to keep moving.

                <h2>LaunchCode</h2>
                <p>
                    I heard of Launchcode from my father. 
                    I went ahead &amp; applied, and got accepted!
                    I was learning python at this course, and was doing very well!
                    While doing this I was also still working at my job full time.
                    A little after unit 1 I had to drop out to take care of my mom.
                    Now that my mom is back to good health I was ready to try this again!
                    And thats how I got here!
